# ML Learning Journey

This repo documents my structured deep learning upskilling alongside 8+ years of production AI/ML delivery experience. My applied work (RAG systems, Agentic AI, Claude API integrations) lives in enterprise environments — this repo focuses on strengthening my theoretical ML foundations.

   ## Production AI Projects (Enterprise)
   - Finance Query Automation — Agentic AI, Intent Classification, SAP API
   - Policy RAG Assistant — RAG, Vector DB, OpenSearch
   - Intelligent Document Generation — Claude API, Prompt Engineering
   - AI Meeting Intelligence — Transcript API, LLM summarization, Monday.com
   
   **Current Focus:** Deep Learning Fundamentals (CS231n)
   
   ## Timeline
